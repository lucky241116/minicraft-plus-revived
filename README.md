# minicraft-plus-revived
Minicraft+, code taken from version 1.6 originally, with the goal of adding back all the features currently in 1.8.

The idea is to sort of merge the other repository (minicraft-plus-decompiled) with this one, since this one has better-looking code, but the other has more features because it's further ahead.

In the end, the other repository should be depricated, as it's frankly not fun to work with, as with pretty much all decompiled code.
