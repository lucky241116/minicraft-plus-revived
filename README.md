# minicraft-plus-revived
Minicraft+, code taken from version 1.6 originally, with the goal of adding back all the features currently in 1.8.

The idea is to sort of merge the decompiled code of 1.8 with this code, since this code is better-looking, but the other has more features and it's further ahead.


###The plan:

1. Finish reintegrating the 1.8 features back into the 1.6 code; and clean it up at the same time.
2. Add new features! Use ideas from:
  * other minicraft versions
  * minecraft
  * my / other people's imagination

####Current Bugs / Quick Fixes:

* Sound effect don't always play when they should.
* beds, and dungeon chests, are sort of half-implemented at the moment.
* Clean up and simplify the code in various java files to make them both easier to follow and easier to develop.
* I have a system in place to save custom key controls, but lack the menu to edit them... I need to get that fixed.

###Long-term Goals:

* Add commenting work done in [this repository](https://github.com/shylor/miniventure) to applicable code.

* Add back:
  * Spawners
  * Potions
  * Colored Clothes
  * Experience (from 1.4)

* Tool and armor durability
  * Make armor cut a percent of damage, rather than act as extra hearts


####Ideas for future additions:

* Auto-update system
* Multiplayer Servers
  * Custom usernames
* Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts

  It's worth note that these are simply **ideas**, and have no garuntee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all.
