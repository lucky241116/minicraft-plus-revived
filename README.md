# minicraft-plus-revived
Minicraft+, a modded version of minicraft that adds many more features to the original version. To learn more about minicraft, or play it yourself, take a look at [www.playminicraft.com](https://www.playminicraft.com).

This mod has resumed active development after a few years of inactivity, which caused a bit of trouble; but by now, it is finally back up and running, though the code isn't the prettiest at the moment. I'm working on it, though! :D

## Current Major Features:
Here is a small share of the more major features that this mod adds to the original minicraft game:
* More Game modes -- Creative, Hardcore, and Score mode in addition to Survival
* Save / Load System for worlds and settings
* Many more mobs
* Personal crafting menu
* Potions
* New weapons / tools, such as claymores and torches
* Beds
* Mob Spawners (with loot chests)
* expanded storyline; 4th dungeon level, and Second Boss
* 
* Bigger screen size

That's all I can remember right now; you can find a more comprehensive list in [this minecraft forum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/off-topic/general-gaming/452036-v1-6-minicraft-plus). Be aware however, that it's old; it's from many years ago before the project was abandoned.

#### Current Bugs / Needed Fixes:

* Sound effect don't always play when they should.

* Clean up and simplify the code in various java files to make them both easier to follow and easier to develop.

### Long-term Goals:

* Add commenting work done in [this repository](https://github.com/shylor/miniventure) to applicable code.
  * Has now been done for many files; but there are still more to go...
* Also, just reformat code in general; still needs more work 
* Add back:
  * Spawners
  * Colored Clothes
  * Experience (from 1.4)

* Tool and armor durability
  * Make armor cut a percent of damage, rather than act as extra hearts

* Chest item transfer
  * I personally can't stand how with chests, you always have to transfer all of a particular item, and you can't choose how much. I plan to change that.

#### Ideas for future additions:

* Auto-update system
* Multiplayer Servers
  * Custom usernames
* Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts

  It's worth note that these are simply **ideas**, and have no garuntee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all. If they become more likely to implement, they will be move to "Long Term Goals".


##### Random Note: LevelGen.java has it's own main method; use it to generate an image of a randomly generated map.
