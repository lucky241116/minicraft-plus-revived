# minicraft-plus-revived
Minicraft+, a modded version of minicraft that adds many more features to the original version. To learn more about minicraft, or play it yourself, take a look at [www.playminicraft.com](https://www.playminicraft.com).

This mod has resumed active development after a few years of inactivity, which caused a bit of trouble; but by now, it is finally back up and running, though the code isn't the prettiest at the moment. I'm working on it, though! :D

## Major Features
Here is a small share of the more major features that this mod adds to the original minicraft game:
* More Game modes -- Creative, Hardcore, and Score mode in addition to Survival
* Save / Load System for worlds and settings
* Many more mobs
* Personal crafting menu
* Potions
* New weapons / tools, such as claymores and torches
* Beds
* Mob Spawners (with loot chests)
* expanded storyline; 4th dungeon level, and Second Boss
* 
* Bigger screen size

That's all I can remember right now; you can find a more comprehensive list in [this minecraft forum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/off-topic/general-gaming/452036-v1-6-minicraft-plus). Be aware however, that it's old; it's from many years ago before the project was abandoned.

### Current Goals

Things I plan on implementing, _hopefully_ sooner rather than later... ;)

* Finish reformatting the code in general; it still needs some more work to get it up to standards.
  * Add commenting work done in [this repository](https://github.com/shylor/miniventure) to applicable code. This has now been done for many files; but there are still more to go...

* Modify the health system; likely by redoing armor, and perhaps the hunger too, so you still regenerate some health when you're at 9/10 hunger and such

* Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles. Otherwise, they're useful for nothing...

### Ideas for future additions

Things I will probably add later, rather than sooner.

* Auto-update system -- though, I might move this up, if this actually becomes something many people use.
* Add back Experience bar, from version 1.4
* Make the game window resizeable; maybe even full-screen..?


#### Far, far away...

These are simply **ideas**, and have no guarantee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all. Could be becuase they're complicated, or could be because I just haven't bothered considering them yet. :P
If their implementation becomes more likely, they will be moved to a different section.

* Multiplayer Servers
  * Custom usernames
* Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts


##### Random Note: LevelGen.java has it's own main method; it's used for debug purposes, to make images of the randomly generated maps that the class makes.
