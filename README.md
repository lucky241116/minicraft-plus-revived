# minicraft-plus-revived
Minicraft+, code taken from version 1.6 originally, with the goal of adding back all the features currently in 1.8.

The idea is to sort of merge the [minicraft-plus-decompiled](https://github.com/chrisj42/minicraft-plus-decompiled) repository with this one, since this one has better-looking code, but the other has more features because it's further ahead.

In the end, the other repository will be depricated, and probably deleted, as this one will be the pretty much the same code, but better.


###The plan:

1. Finish reintegrating the 1.8 features back into the 1.6 code; and clean it up at the same time.
2. Add new features! Use ideas from:
  * other minicraft versions
  * minecraft
  * my / other people's imagination

####Current Bugs / Quick Fixes:

* Get "Saving" dialog to appear; make "r" key initiate save.
* Sound effect don't always play when they should
* beds, and dungeon chests, are sort of half-implemented at the moment
* Some java files (Mainly the ones taken from the decompiled source code) could really use some cleaning up and simplifying, both to make them easier to follow, and easier to develop.


###Long-term Goals:

* Add commenting work done in [this repository](https://github.com/shylor/miniventure) to applicable code.

* Add back:
  * Spawners
  * Potions
  * Colored Clothes
  * Experience (from 1.4)

* Tool and armor durability
  * Make armor cut a percent of damage, rather than act as extra hearts


####Ideas for future additions:

* Auto-update system
* Multiplayer Servers
  * Custom usernames
* Custom Skins
* Redstone
* Fire
* Chickens
* Minecarts

  It's worth note that these are simply **ideas**, and have no garuntee of being implemented any time soon, or even at all.
