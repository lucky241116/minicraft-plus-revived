You can find a more comprehensive list of the earlier versions, before 1.9, in this minecraft forum [post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/off-topic/general-gaming/452036-v1-6-minicraft-plus). ([archived copy](https://chrisj42.github.io/minicraft-plus-revived/Old%20changelog.html)) Be aware however, that it's old; it's from many years ago before the original project was abandoned.
