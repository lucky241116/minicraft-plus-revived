Comment anew:

entity/Arrow
entity/Creeper
entity/DungeonChest
entity/Knight
entity/Skeleton
entity/Snake
entity/Tnt
entity/Spawner
entity/(Pig/Sheep/Cow) -- will likely combine these later.

saveload/*

screen/CraftInvMenu
screen/LoadingMenu (about a page)
screen/ModeMenu
screen/OptionsMenu
screen/PauseMenu
screen/PlayerInfoMenu
screen/TitleMenu
screen/WonMenu (needs a LOT more than comments!)
screen/WorldGenMenu
screen/WorldSelectMenu

-------------------------------------
There are more... but they are new, and have no previous comments. To find them, search for a comment on the first line of the class.
Usually, it's "//new class, no comments." But some are "//new features, less comments." or something like that.


*******************************************************************************
Classes that need attention:

-Chest.java: reformat

-Furniture.java: maybe combine subclasses, to remove a bunch of the bulk... or maybe, just move more of the code into this class.

-WonMenu.java: reformat; freshly decompiled, it seems...

-ALL the tile/* classes. This is going to be a project.
