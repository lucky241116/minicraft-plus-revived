	####BUGS####
####
arrow icon is slightly off-center, and doesn't have a black box around it.
####
Enchanter and Workbench are added to the inventory twice.
####
Player Camera doesn't go out all the way to the edge. 
####
New world Loading percent doesn't increment at all...
####
####
dungeon chests are sort of half-implemented at the moment; their keys don't seem to be a thing. That needs to be fixed.
####
When creating a second world during the same execution (ie not closing the jar file), the loading percentage starts at 100%. Should be an easy fix.
####
Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.
####

	****IDEAS****
****
Implement potions!
****
Get AirWizard II working, including the health bar being local.
****
Make the loading system more forgiving, so that if I add a requirement to the save files, the old ones will still work. The idea is that when it expects 5 options and only finds 4, it just keeps those at default.
****
Make window resizable, and menus will be fine.
****
Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles.

request: more health
