	---Quick TODO's---
-Add more info to player info menu

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	####BUGS####
####
Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.
####
newly spawned zombies don't go to one health for creative..?
####
new worlds use the current/previous keyboard presets, rather than the default ones, when creating a new world after loading a previous one.
####
Many item names don't fit on the black "active item" bar at the bottom.

	****IDEAS****
****

There's a lot to do in the Tile classes... many methods have many unnecessary parameters... and the torch effects account for all the "light" and "torch" static tiles in Tile.java. I think I'll make a HashMap out of that list, as well.

****

Make a TextPage class or something, for the About and Instructions sections of the TitleMenu; really, it's for pages that are non-interactive, just a bunch of text.
Also, add controls listing somewhere. Probably closely related to the below idea.

****

I have a system in place to save custom key controls, but lack the menu to edit them... I need to get that implemented.
	How about... another menu class, SelectMenu? It will parent all the cursor selection and scrollable menus; I can use it for the new KeymapMenu, and also WorldSelectMenu and InventoryMenu, with scrolling; the other menus won't use the scroll feature, but I can just make a boolean for that, I think.
	For those menus that don't even have a cursor, though, perhaps I could just make it a Menu..? If that doesn't work, I can always make a ChoiceMenu class, super simple, that just displays two choices with no cursor, and listens for enter and escape keypresses.

****

Make it so friendly mobs (sheep, pigs, cows) spawn during the day, but evil mobs don't.

****

change the getEntity methods, and similar, so that errors, or invalid object requests, can be easily found with a "missing texture" entity, rather than defaulting to a Zombie.

****

Support Color.get(String) where the string is four characters, made up of t,w,b; t=transparent, w=white, and b=black. That might look better. Of course, what WOULD look better is Color.red, Color.white, etc.
	Maybe I could even devise Color.lighten and/or Color.darken methods, that would work for making the daylight cycle color sets.

****

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.

****

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

* * * * More complicated ideas * * * *

Make the loading system more forgiving, so that if I add a requirement to the save files, the old ones will still work. The idea is that when it expects 5 options and only finds 4, it just keeps those at default.

* * * *

Make window resizable, and menus will be fine.
	I think.... I think a lot of this will simply be changing all the 16's to "scale".
	Well... maybe not. The "16" is a part of rendering; instead, I should probably just make the "pixels" bigger.

* * * *

Improve creative inventory system; perhaps just make it so you always have one of everything?
Also inventory system in general, such as moving items to and from inventories, into chests; you should be able to choose how much of an item stack you want to transfer.

* * * *

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

* * * *

*?*?*?* Questionable Additions *?*?*?*

remove OptionsMenu from title screen? All the features, besides sound, perhaps, seem like they should be world-specific... well.... actually, they should be *user* specific... but "users" aren't a thing at the moment, so I just assume that different worlds are different users. That probably needs to change... for now, though, I'll just leave it be.

*?*?*?*

Change potion checking system to get rid of bools, and just check if the potion effect exists instead of checking the bools? Could be less nice... though if I do that and use a HashMap, then I could remove both the bools, and the PotionEffect subclass...

*?*?*?*

Make all Class instance lists similar to ListItems, but static; so, each one has a "get" method accepting a string. Maybe I could make them all extend a "ClassList" or "InstanceList" interface or something...

In a similar/related vein, make each subclass of these store their own lists of their instances, and they will just be added to the main one.
So, for resources, PotionResource would have a static list of all the potion resources, and Resource would just add those to it's collection.

Hmm... Actually, I have a better idea. How about I just instantiate everything in the list classes, but have the sub-classes record each instance? They could be recorded in a HashMap, with a string key for the name, that fetches the associated object instance.

*?*?*?*

Make menu frames change size based on the largest (text) item in it. Not totally sure I want to do it...

*?*?*?*

Fix entity removal when sleeping? I think the idea is that all mobs within a certain radius are removed when you go to sleep; but that doesn't happen, and in fact, they still track you when you're in bed... I could fix that, maybe.
