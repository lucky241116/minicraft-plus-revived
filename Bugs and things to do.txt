TODO: check that airwizard costume really does allow you to walk on air tiles.

	####BUGS####
####
Airwizard health bar is off-center.
####
Regular "potion"s can be used even though they have no effect; they need to not do anything when someone attempts to use them.
####
Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.

	****IDEAS****
****
I have a system in place to save custom key controls, but lack the menu to edit them... I need to get that implemented.
****
Fix the whitespace; where it indents without a semicolon, mostly. I've done it before...
****
Make the loading system more forgiving, so that if I add a requirement to the save files, the old ones will still work. The idea is that when it expects 5 options and only finds 4, it just keeps those at default.
****
Make window resizable, and menus will be fine.
	I think.... I think a lot of this will simply be changing all the 8's to "scale".
****
Improve creative inventory system; perhaps just make it so you always have one of everything?
Also inventory system in general
****
Fix entity removal when sleeping? I think the idea is that all mobs within a certain radius are removed when you go to sleep; but that doesn't happen, and in fact, they still track you when you're in bed... I could fix that, maybe.
****
Find something to do with Npc.java; currently, was never even implemented in the first place, even though it was made...
****
