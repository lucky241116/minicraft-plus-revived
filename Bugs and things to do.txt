	---Quick TODO's---

--CURRENT: 

- ping server every 5 seconds, and if it doesn't respond after 3 consecutive pings, disconnect automatically.
- remove all players from level on server when someone uses a bed; then add them all back when they get out
  -- or better yet, maybe make a system to not speed up time until everyone is in bed?

Note to self: for more little bugs/ideas/concerns, search code for "TODO"

	####BUGS####
####
Well. I've learned something. I really ought to be aware of hashes, since I've overridden .equals(), but not .hashCode(), so if I've used HashMaps or HashSets of objects of those classes, they may not work right. They will not follow the specified .equals() method. I'm not sure if I expected it to, but now that I know, I can override it and make use of HashMaps/HashSets to improve performance in lists. And it will no longer be cloudy as to what will affect Object.equals(); as long as I implement both methods, it should compare objects solely using those methods.

investigate the disappearace of furniture -- I think I may be getting it with dungeon chests.
####
PastDay1 doesn't save/work, I think.
####
Something weird happens with creeper explosions... I think, if you stay next to it, then the game freezes. Or maybe it has something to do with the spawner..? Idk, it's really wierd...

MULTIPLAYER-Related:
 # Spawner level should change upon hitting it in creative; it only works with menu button

 # Players aren't kicked out if they are on a menu when the server goes down..? (only tested/seen once)
 
 # Sounds play in multiplayer even when game is paused, and when another player does something far away; add checks for distance and pause state before playing sounds
 
 It would be nice if I could find a way to not even bother telling the server for things like potions, that don't even interact with the world.

	****IDEAS(that should probably be implemented)****
****

Make an Interactable interface, and both Entity AND Tile implement it, because both are interactable. Interactable holds methods for things like collision detection, tangibility, events for touching, and events for player key presses like interact ("v") and attack (that will also pickup furniture; it's sort of like, "swipe"). There will be a dedicated button to open the inventory. intereact will open chests, activate tnt, etc.

****

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

****

Add more colors? Or try and turn sprites into 32x32 (currently are 16x16) for better graphics? Also, change game aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9. This probably means searching for hard-coding refs to the screen size, and changing them. Also make smaller font size, for chat and debug.

****

COULD BE IRRELEVANT DUE TO UPCOMING RENDERING OVERHAUL
make it so all tile sprites are calculated only once, then get updated whenever something happens in an adjacent tile. Might help especially with ConnectorSprites, I think. To do this, I'll just have to make an update method in the Tile class, and somehow save the last generated sprite..?

****

make the text when typing a world name become uppercase according to English locale.

****

Go over all the "Warnings" from Xlint, and fix them.

****

reorder tools a bit in ToolType.java b/c I'm picky. Hoes should be first, at least. ;)

****

add to F3 menu: "heartticks" left until regen another heart.
