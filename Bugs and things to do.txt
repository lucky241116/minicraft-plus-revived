Implement potions!

Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.

When creating a second world during the same execution (ie not closing the jar file), the loading percentage starts at 100%. Should be an easy fix.

Make the loading system more forgiving, so that if I add a requirement to the save files, the old ones will still work. The idea is that when it expects 5 options and only finds 4, it just keeps those at default.

Make window resizable, and menus will be fine.

Go though all the files and reformat them to make them easier to read. Or better yet, find a program that formats java files...
