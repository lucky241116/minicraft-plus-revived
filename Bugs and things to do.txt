	####BUGS####
####
Airwizard health bar is off-center.
####
Airwizard II fails to appear when it's supposed to.
####
Regular "potion"s can be used even though they have no effect; they need to not do anything when someone attempts to use them.
####
Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.

	****IDEAS****
****
Fix the whitespace; where it indents without a semicolon, mostly. I've done it before...
****
Make the loading system more forgiving, so that if I add a requirement to the save files, the old ones will still work. The idea is that when it expects 5 options and only finds 4, it just keeps those at default.
****
Make window resizable, and menus will be fine.
	I think.... I think a lot of this will simply be changing all the 8's to "scale".
****
Make it so cloud tile can be placed in the sky level, on empty air tiles. Otherwise, they're useful for nothing...
****
Improve creative inventory system; perhaps just make it so you always have one of everything?
****
Idea to improve code for Level.java: make method "removeNearbyEntities(Entity target, int radius)" to easily remove entites near, say, the player, whenever we want. Although, it would really only be used while sleeping...so really, it's rather pointless, as a method...
****
Add "experience" feature back from minicraft+ 1.4.
