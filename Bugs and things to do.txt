-remove duplicate splashes
-add if player is wearing airwizard suit to save file
-Add more info to player info menu

	####BUGS####
####
Regular "potion"s can be used even though they have no effect; they need to not do anything when someone attempts to use them.
####
Sound effects don't always play when they should; mostly it seems when other sounds should be on at the same time.

	****IDEAS****
****
I have a system in place to save custom key controls, but lack the menu to edit them... I need to get that implemented.
	How about... another menu class, SelectMenu? It will parent all the cursor selection and scrollable menus; I can use it for the new KeymapMenu, and also WorldSelectMenu and InventoryMenu, with scrolling; the other menus won't use the scroll feature, but I can just make a boolean for that, I think.
	For those menus that don't even have a cursor, though, perhaps I could just make it a Menu..? If that doesn't work, I can always make a ChoiceMenu class, super simple, that just displays two choices with no cursor, and listens for enter and escape keypresses.
****
Make menu frames change size based on the largest (text) item in it. Not totally sure I want to do it...
****
check Tile methods; many of them have many unnecessary parameters...
****
Make it so friendly mobs (sheep, pigs, cows) spawn during the day, but evil mobs don't.
****
change the getEntity methods, and similar, so that errors, or invalid object requests, can be easily found with a "missing texture" entity, rather than defaulting to a Zombie.
****
Support Color.get(String) where the string is four characters, made up of t,w,b; t=transparent, w=white, and b=black. That might look better. Of course, what WOULD look better is Color.red, Color.white, etc.
	Maybe I could even devise Color.lighten and/or Color.darken methods, that would work for making the daylight cycle color sets.
****
Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.
****
Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.
****
Make the loading system more forgiving, so that if I add a requirement to the save files, the old ones will still work. The idea is that when it expects 5 options and only finds 4, it just keeps those at default.
****
Make window resizable, and menus will be fine.
	I think.... I think a lot of this will simply be changing all the 16's to "scale".
	Well... maybe not. The "16" is a part of rendering; instead, I should probably just make the "pixels" bigger.
****
Improve creative inventory system; perhaps just make it so you always have one of everything?
Also inventory system in general, such as moving items to and from inventories, into chests; you should be able to choose how much of an item stack you want to transfer.
****
Fix entity removal when sleeping? I think the idea is that all mobs within a certain radius are removed when you go to sleep; but that doesn't happen, and in fact, they still track you when you're in bed... I could fix that, maybe.
****
Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...
