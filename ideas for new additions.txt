 -------- Simple Ideas --------

----

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

----

Make it so friendly mobs (sheep, pigs, cows) spawn during the day, but evil mobs don't.

----

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.

----

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

----

change inventory system to allow moving items to and from inventories, into chests; for example, you should be able to choose how much of an item stack you want to transfer.

 ++++++++ More Complicated Ideas ++++++++

++++

change the getEntity methods, and similar, so that errors, or invalid object requests, can be easily found with a "missing texture" entity, rather than defaulting to a Zombie.

++++

Improve creative inventory system; perhaps just make it so you always have one of everything?

++++

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

++++

Fix entity removal when sleeping? I think the idea is that all mobs within a certain radius are removed when you go to sleep; but that doesn't happen, and in fact, they still track you when you're in bed... I could fix that, maybe.

++++

Make a way to resize the font... In specific instances only, though, I'm thinking. For example, the F3 overlay.

 ???????? Questionable Ideas ????????

????

Support Color.get(String) where the string is four characters, made up of t,w,b; t=transparent, w=white, and b=black. That might look better. Of course, what WOULD look better is Color.red, Color.white, etc.
	Maybe I could even devise Color.lighten and/or Color.darken methods, that would work for making the daylight cycle color sets.

????

Make menu frames change size based on the largest (text) item in it. Not totally sure I want to do it...
