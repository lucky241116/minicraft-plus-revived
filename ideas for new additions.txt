 -------- Simple Ideas --------
----

Add world copy option, like rename and delete.

----

Remove the PowGlove entirely, in favor of a new control key, like "v", to "pickup" things. Perhaps, make it only work when nothing is in your hand?

----

change "xa" and "ya" to something else; b/c they are NOT accelerations! They're distances! Specifically, they are the distance that a given entity is about to move.

----

Add feature to notifications display: if it starts with ":error:", then make the text red (but don't show the ":Error:" part). Any further than that, though, and it would be better to just pass it in.

----

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

----

change inventory system to allow moving items to and from inventories, into chests; for example, you should be able to choose how much of an item stack you want to transfer.

----

Give the player 20 health instead of 10; this means that 1 health will be a half of a heart.

 ++++++++ More Complicated Ideas ++++++++
++++

Add a system to more properly find the home/data dir on different OS's; windows doesn't regconize "."[filename] as hidden, I think, so that should be accounted for as well.

++++

change the getEntity methods, and similar, so that errors, or invalid object requests, can be easily found with a "missing texture" entity, rather than defaulting to a Zombie.

++++

Improve creative inventory system; perhaps just make it so you always have one of everything?

++++

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

++++

Turn player.score into the experience system of 1.4; or, maybe I should just make my own experience system... it wouldn't hurt to use things like colors and such from 1.4, though.

++++

Make a way to resize the font... In specific instances only, though, I'm thinking. For example, the F3 overlay.

++++




 ???????? Questionable Ideas ????????

????

Add a feature so that a changelog will be displayed if on lower version...?

????

Support Color.get(String) where the string is four characters, made up of t,w,b; t=transparent, w=white, and b=black. That might look better. Of course, what WOULD look better is Color.red, Color.white, etc.
	Maybe I could even devise Color.lighten and/or Color.darken methods, that would work for making the daylight cycle color sets.

Better idea: simplify it another way; just make a simple method in Color.java to make it so that if the last 3 colors are the same, you just type it once; so instead of Color.get(-1, 555, 555, 555), it's just Color.get(-1, 555).

????

Make menu frames change size based on the largest (text) item in it. Not totally sure I want to do it...
