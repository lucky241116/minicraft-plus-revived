Ideas for entirely new features not previously part of the game.
++++++

Bacon.
+
Milk & bad status effects.

++++

Invisibility potion: Allows you to go through walls, but lava will still hurt you. If you get stuck in a wall, you will begin to take suffocation damage as in Minecraft.
+
Escape potion: Brings you up one level, or to the surface (haven't decided yet).
+
Ragdoll potion: Allows you to control other mobs, but not other players.

++++

Add signs. So, when you walk over them, a message is displayed!

++++

add a key input (default shift-attack, aka shift-c)  that charges your attack rather than spamming it. Will probably do as much damage as however many spams you could have done while charging, a full stamina bar's worth; the difference is, you deal the damage all at once.

++++

Jukeboxes / noteblocks.

++++

Add maps. Possible crafting recipe: bones and leather.
One for each level on the smallest world size, and progressively more maps should be needed otherwise. Should I make the maps lock to "chuck" sort of locations, or always make the center the current location, where possible? It could work by having a mini-map in the upper-left whenever the map is the active item, and there is no menu open.

++++

Bone meal to make trees grow. Though I might make something else that has the same functionality, instead.

++++

tipped/enchanted arrows

++++

fire
+
fireballs

++++

add controller support

++++

Make beds colorable

++++

Add giants, and make them eat trees.

++++

make friendly mobs able to be fed and bred, and led.

++++

Add world backup option, that user can select a download location. Then maybe... pack to zip? Also, I'll need to make a "restore" feature, and unzip it, so this could get complicated...

++++

Custom skins

++++

Enchantments

++++

World editors

++++

Boats; though I don't see them being *too* useful without infinite terrain and vast oceans...

++++
