Most of the stuff here won't make sense unless you have a prior knowledge of the code structure and details.
~~~~~~

Find something to do with Npc.java, and Giant.java; currently, they were never even implemented in the first place, even though they were made...

~~~~

Turn player.score into the experience system of 1.4; or, maybe I should just make my own experience system... it wouldn't hurt to use things like colors and such from 1.4, though.

~~~~

Make the "sticky keys" feature off by default on survival, and on by default on creative.

~~~~

PROJECT: encapsulate many classes, as much as possible. This means making preferably zero public fields, and so making more getters and setters... I haven't done that very well...

~~~~

Stop saving player arrow count, and refit the load class indexes to reflect that. I should really find a better way to represent each piece of info in loading, so the removal of one save item doesn't break everything.
